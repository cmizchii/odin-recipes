   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>Pizza is a beloved dish that originated in Italy, known for its crispy, chewy crust topped with a flavorful tomato sauce, melted cheese, and an array of delicious toppings. The versatility of pizza allows for endless variations, whether it's a classic Margherita with fresh basil, a meat lover's pizza loaded with sausage and pepperoni, or a veggie-packed version with mushrooms, peppers, and onions. The dough is typically made from flour, yeast, water, and olive oil, then baked at high temperatures to create a golden, bubbly, and slightly charred crust. Pizza is a perfect balance of savory, cheesy goodness, and it's enjoyed worldwide as a comfort food, perfect for sharing with friends or family at any time of day.</p>
